                According to the Ministry of Environment, light pollution refers to a condition in which excessive light due to improper use of artificial lighting or light leaking out of the lighting area to be illuminated interferes with people`&apos;`s healthy and pleasant lives or damages the environment. Although this type of pollution can exist throughout the day, its effects are magnified during the night with the contrast of darkness.The area affected by artificial illumination continues to increase. The Starry night raises awareness of the phenomenon that light pollution is getting worse as urbanization gets worse. This project also tried to show the seriousness of light pollution in each country and the seriousness of each country.
